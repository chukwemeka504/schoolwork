    <h1 id="history">A Brief History of the <a href="https://www.uniduna.hu/en/about-us/brief-history">university of dunaujvaros</a></h1> 
    <p>The first and only higher educational institution in Dunaújváros, 
    the Technicum of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering, our predecessor institution<br> was established in 1953. However,
     as our University is one of the very few<br> universities saveguarding and fostering the nearly 270 years old student traditions developed at Selmecbánya 
     (and for<br> that UOD is considered as a successor institution of the former Academy of Selmecbánya), 
        our university can be described as a relatively young university having roots that goes back centuries.</p>
